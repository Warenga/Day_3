- Binary Search: A BinarySearch class, that inherits from list class. Given the length of a list and the step or difference between consecutive values, it searches for a given number and returns a dictionary of { count: index }. Where count is the number of times you function iterated to find the index of the number in question and index is the index of the number in question.

- Missing number: A function that accepts two almost identical lists and returns the number that is missing in one of the lists.
